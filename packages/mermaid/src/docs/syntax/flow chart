A[Start: Mixture of Phenol (PhOH) and Benzyl Alcohol (PhCH2OH)] --> B[Dissolve in Organic Solvent]    B --> C[Add Aqueous NaOH Solution]
C --> D[Phenol converts to Phenoxide Ion (PhO^-Na+)]
C --> E[Benzyl Alcohol remains in Organic Layer]
D --> F[Separate Aqueous Layer from Organic Layer]
E --> F
F --> G[Aqueous Layer: Contains Phenoxide Ion (PhO^-Na+)]
F --> H[Organic Layer: Contains Benzyl Alcohol (PhCH2OH)]
G --> I[Acidify Aqueous Layer with HCl]
I --> J[Phenoxide Ion converts back to Phenol (PhOH)]
J --> K[Extract Phenol into Fresh Portion of Organic Solvent]
K --> L[Dry Organic Layer with Anhydrous Na2SO4]
L --> M[Evaporate Organic Solvent]
M --> N[Obtain Pure Phenol (PhOH)]
H --> O[Dry Initial Organic Layer with Anhydrous Na2SO4]
O --> P[Evaporate Organic Solvent]
P --> Q[Obtain Pure Benzyl Alcohol (PhCH2OH)]
N --> R[End: Separated Pure Phenol and Pure Benzyl Alcohol]
Q --> R
